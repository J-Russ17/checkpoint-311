HOW THIS API WORKS:

Creates an express application
Connect to a MySQL database
Takes incoming requests (GET, PUT, POST, UPDATE, DELETE)
Routes those requests through the routes.js file
Within those routes are callback functions passed in from the controller file
The controller file contains the logic that is to be performed when a specific route is called
